Orion Terminal Utility For Managing Files

For improving my skills with the C programming language i decide to build a small CLI utility program that emulate the cp/mv standard linux operation.

With this tool you are able to copy or move file or the entire content of a directory with a bunch of additional options.

This project is free and open source software so fell free to use it!!!
